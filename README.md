DAWN

website for the DAWN project. DAWN is a platform where students, teachers, and experts in diverse fields can come together to share ideas outside of the classroom. The 
topics discussed during each section are meant to push the students to engage into 
critical thinking and influence each other. The dynamic includes a main speaker who is
supposed to guide the conversion into a balanced and equitative experience for all 
participants. A prerequisite is having a your camara turned on so that the interactionamong pariticipants feels personal and real.
